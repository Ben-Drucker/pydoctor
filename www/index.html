          It is an API documentation tool for Python, somewhat
          like <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a>, 
          <a href="http://pudge.lesscode.org/">Pudge</a>,
          <a href="http://www.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/EndoHowTo">Endo</a>
          or <a href="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net/">HappyDoc</a>.

          pydoctor was written to be used by
          the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> project, which was using
          used <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">epydoc</a>, but it was becoming
          <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-web/2006-January/002406.html">
          hard to use</a> for various reasons and development on it seemed to have halted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to use most of the tools listed above; Pudge crashed, Endo seemed to
          depend on the <em>enormous</em> Enthought package and HappyDoc is to all
          appearances dead as a door-nail.  So, when I had a long-ish journey to make I
          started coding, and a week or so of evenings later with some help from
          Christopher Armstrong and a few others, had something that was actually useful.
