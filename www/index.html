        What is pydoctor?

        <p>
          It is an API documentation tool for Python, somewhat
          like <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a>, 
          <a href="http://pudge.lesscode.org/">Pudge</a>,
          <a href="http://www.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/EndoHowTo">Endo</a>
          or <a href="http://happydoc.sourceforge.net/">HappyDoc</a>.

        Why?

          pydoctor was written to be used by
          the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> project which was
          using <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">epydoc</a> but was becoming
          increasingly
          <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-web/2006-January/002406.html">
          unhappy</a> with it for various reasons.  In addition, development on Epydoc
          seemed to have halted.
        </p>
        <p>
          I tried to use most of the tools listed above; Pudge crashed, Endo seemed to
          depend on the <em>enormous</em> Enthought package and HappyDoc is to all
          appearances dead as a door-nail.  So, when I had a long-ish journey to make I
          started coding, and a week or so of evenings later with some help from
          Christopher Armstrong and a few others, had something that was actually useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          The needs of the twisted project are still the main driving force for pydoctor's
          development, but it is getting to the point where there's some chance that it is
          useful for your project too.

        Who wrote it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Michael "mwh" Hudson, PyPy and CPython hacker, with help from Christopher
          "radix" Armstrong and Jonathan "jml" Lange and advice and ideas from many people
          who hang out in #twisted on freenode.

        Where do I get it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          From Subversion, currently.
        </p>
        <pre>
          svn co <a href="http://codespeak.net/svn/user/mwh/pydoctor/trunk">http://codespeak.net/svn/user/mwh/pydoctor/trunk</a> pydoctor
        </pre>
        <p>
          Or something like that.

        How do I use it?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          This is a big enough topic to deserve its <a href="usage.html">own page</a>.
        </p>

      <dt>
        Where do I report bugs?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          There is a pydoctor component in
          the <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac">trac instance</a>
          on <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">twistedmatrix.com</a>.  Assign to mwh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, if it's daytime in Europe, turning up in #twisted and hassling mwh
          works reasonably well.
