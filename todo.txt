HTML Formatter:
  X render method docs on class pages
  - Do something useful with superclass info (inheritance hierarchy!)
  - show function signatures for functions in "children" tables
  - Do something useful with Interface information (needs to be added to model)
    - blue boxes for interface docstrings in implementation methods?
  - Make L{Deferred} magically work when Deferred isn't in the namespace
  - Better support for epydoc 'flags' (parameter, return, variable
    specifications)
  - Parameterise epydoc usage instead of just basing on presence of epydoc
  - templates
  - Make Pretty

Model:
  - Add Interface information to model
