HTML Formatter:

  - X render method docs on class pages
  - Do something useful with superclass info (inheritance hierarchy!)
  - show function signatures for functions in "children" tables
  - Do something more useful with Interface information
    - blue boxes for interface docstrings in implementation methods?
    - work out a sensible way to display deeper interface information.
  - Make L{Deferred} magically work when Deferred isn't in the namespace
  - Better support for epydoc 'fields' (parameter, return, variable
    specifications)
  - Parameterise epydoc usage instead of just basing on presence of epydoc
  - templates
  - Make Pretty

Model:

  - sanitize the model of tracking interface implementations wrt
    inheritance
  - make it possible to pickle the system after each step
  - think fairly hard about how robust the code is -- we should
    *never* crash out.
  - understand import * from a package

Other:

  - beat up the command line interface (options for output pickle file
    name and the system class to use at the very least seem like a
    good thing(tm))
  - make it so the trailing slash doesn't count when you say
    "makedocsys -r /some/code" (probably part of above)
